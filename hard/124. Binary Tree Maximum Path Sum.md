# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    maxSum = -2**31
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.cur(root)
        return self.maxSum
    def cur(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        left = self.cur(node.left)
        right = self.cur(node.right)
        self.maxSum = max(max(max(max(left + node.val, right + node.val), left+ right + node.val), self.maxSum),node.val)
        return max(max(left + node.val, right + node.val), node.val)
