# A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

Solution: 
```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        queue = [{ "word": beginWord, "currentStep": 1 }]
        visitedWords = set()
        while len(queue) > 0:  
            currentWord = queue.pop(0)   
            word = currentWord["word"]
            if word in visitedWords:
                continue
            
            currentStep = currentWord["currentStep"]
            if word == endWord:
                return currentStep

            visitedWords.add(word)

            for s in wordList:
                if (self.isSimilar(word, s) == True):
                    queue.append({ 'word': s, 'currentStep': currentStep+1 })
        return 0
    
    def isSimilar(self, word1: str, word2: str):
        diff = 0

        for i in range(len(word1)):
            if not (word1[i] == word2[i]):
                diff+=1
            if diff >= 2:
                return False
        return True
