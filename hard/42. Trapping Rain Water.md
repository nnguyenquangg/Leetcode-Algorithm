# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

```


Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        s = 0
        start = 0
        while start < len(height) -1:
            end = start + 1
            while (end < len(height) and height[end] < height[start]):
                end+=1 

            if (end < len(height)):
                s+= sum([(height[start]) - num for num in height[start:end]])
                start=end
    
            elif (end == len(height)):
                maxValue = max(height[start+1:])
                for j in range(start+1, len(height)):
                    if (maxValue > height[j]):
                        s+=maxValue - height[j]
                    else: 
                        start = j
                        break
            else:
                start+=1
        return s
                
```
