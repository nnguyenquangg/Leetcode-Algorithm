Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

```
k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
```

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Solution:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        result = ListNode()
        link = result
        step = 0
        nums = []
        while (head is not None):
            step+=1
            nums.append(head.val)
            appends = []
            if (step == k or head.next is None):
                appends = nums[::-1] if step == k else nums
                step = 0
                nums = []

            for index in range(len(appends)):
                link.val = appends[index]
                if ((index == len(appends) -1) and head.next is None ):
                    break
                link.next = ListNode()
                link = link.next            
            head = head.next 
        return result
```
