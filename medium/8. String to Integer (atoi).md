# Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.

Solution:


```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        num = 0
        sign = 1
        hasSign = False
        hasNumber = False

        for char in s:
            if (self.is_number(char)):
                hasNumber = True
                num= num*10+ int(char)
            elif (char == "-" or  char == '+'):
                if (hasSign): 
                    break
                hasSign = True
                if (hasNumber):
                    break
                if (char == "-" ):
                    sign = -1
            elif  char == ' ' and  (hasNumber or hasSign):
                break
            elif (not (char == ' ')):
                break

        s = num*sign
        if (s >= 2**31-1):
            return 2**31-1
        if (s <= -2**31):
            return -2**31

        return s

    def is_number(self,value):
        return bool(re.match(r'^-?\d+(\.\d+)?$', value))
