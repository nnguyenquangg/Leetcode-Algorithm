# There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.


```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
```

Solution:
```typescript
var numWaterBottles = function(numBottles, numExchange) {
    let count = numBottles;
    
    let mod = 0;
    
    while (numBottles + mod >= numExchange) {
        count+=  Math.floor((numBottles+mod)/numExchange)
        const sodu = (numBottles+mod) % numExchange  
        numBottles = Math.floor((numBottles+mod)/numExchange)
        mod = sodu
    }
    
    return count
};
```
