# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.


```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```


Solution: 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxArea = 0
        lastIndex = 0
        start = 0
        end = len(height) - 1
        while start < end:
            minHeight = min(height[start], height[end])
            area = minHeight * (end - start)
            maxArea = max(maxArea, area)
            if (height[start] > height[end]): 
                end-=1
            elif (height[start] < height[end]):
                start+=1
            else: 
                end-=1
                start+=1
        return maxArea
```
